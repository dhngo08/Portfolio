I am a Research Analyst at [Onpoint Analystics Inc.](https://onpointanalytics.com/staff/david-ngo/), a company that provides economic and statistical consulting services for high-stakes legal proceedings and business disputes. I perform market research, data analysis, programming and visualization, economic and statistical analysis, and document research. Really, I consider myself a [data junkie.](https://blog.scit.edu/2013/08/05/hey-are-you-a-data-junkie/)

Other bits about myself: I graduated with a B.A. in Combined Economics and Mathematics at UC Santa Cruz and an M.S. in Quantitative Economics at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I was born and raised in the Bay Area, and I'm planning to stay here for quite a while! In my free time, I've been honing my Python and SQL skills, learning the guitar, and playing tabletop RPG games.
