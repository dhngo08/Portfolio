            "content": "For this exercise, I apply Monte Carlo to randomly draw $(x, y)$ values in $[- pi, pi] times [0,1]$. . I then use those values to compute $ int^ pi_{- pi}|cos(2x)|dx=4$. . The code is as follows: . import math import numpy as np from scipy import random # string &#39;fx&#39; is a function in terms of x # a is the lower limit # b is the upper limit # n is the sample size def mc_integral(fx,a,b,n): # defining monte carlo numerical integration method func = lambda x: eval(fx) # argument x and function fx; string fx is parsed and evaluated as a python expression xrand = random.uniform(a,b,n) # generating x values from a normal distribution with range a to b sum_fx = 0 # empty arry to store y values of fx for i in range(n): sum_fx += func(xrand[i]) # summation of computing x values into fx to generate y values answer = (b-a)/n * sum_fx # computing the definite integral of fx between a and b return answer . The function mc_integral should produce some pretty accurate integrations. . Let us try integrating $|cos(2x)|$ with the lower bound $- pi$, upper bound $ pi$, and a sample size 100,000. . print(mc_integral(&#39;abs(math.cos(2*x))&#39;,-np.pi,np.pi, 100000)) . 4.00146350409084 . With the above code, we find that $ int^ pi_{- pi}|cos(2x)|dx approx4$, a value very close to 4. I suppose that&#39;s decent enough :+1: .",

I perform market research, data analysis, programming and visualization, economic and statistical analysis, and document research. Really, I consider myself a data junkie. . Other bits about myself: I graduated with a B.A. in Combined Math/Economics at UC Santa Cruz and an M.S. in Quantitative Economics from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. At Cal Poly, I developed and conducted surveys to identify the data science needs of faculty and staff and to support the development of advanced training programs. I also worked with the Cal Poly Digital Transformation Hub and the World Bank to predict food insecurity in Latin American regions using machine learning algorithms. See more on that here. . In my free time, I’ve been honing my Python and SQL skills, learning the guitar, and playing tabletop games. .",
