I am a Research Analyst at [Onpoint Analystics Inc.](https://onpointanalytics.com/staff/david-ngo/), a company that provides economic and statistical consulting services for legal proceedings and business disputes. I perform market research, data analysis, programming and visualization, economic and statistical analysis, and document research. Really, I consider myself a [data junkie.](https://blog.scit.edu/2013/08/05/hey-are-you-a-data-junkie/)

I graduated with a B.A. in Combined Math/Economics at UC Santa Cruz and an M.S. in Quantitative Economics from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. At Cal Poly, I worked with the Cal Poly Digital Transformation Hub and the World Bank to predict food insecurity in Latin American regions using machine learning algorithms. See more on that [here.](https://dxhub.calpoly.edu/challenges/early-warning-for-early-action/)

In my free time, I enjoy honing my Python and SQL skills, learning the guitar, and playing tabletop games.
