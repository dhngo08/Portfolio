I am a Research Analyst at [Onpoint Analystics Inc.](https://onpointanalytics.com/staff/david-ngo/), a company that provides economic and statistical consulting services for legal proceedings and business disputes. I perform market research, data analysis, programming and visualization, economic and statistical analysis, and document research. Really, I consider myself a [data junkie.](https://blog.scit.edu/2013/08/05/hey-are-you-a-data-junkie/)

In my free time, I've been honing my Python and SQL skills, learning the guitar, and playing tabletop games.
